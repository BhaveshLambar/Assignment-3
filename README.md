# Assignment-3

This repository contains two Python programs focusing on functions and the use of the `math` module:

### Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
- Defines a `factorial` function that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop or recursion.
- Calls the function with a sample number (e.g., 5).
- Prints the calculated factorial.

### Task 2: Math Module Calculations
- Prompts the user to input a number.
- Uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `math` module to calculate:
  - Square root
  - Natural logarithm (log base *e*)
  - Sine (in radians)
- Displays all results clearly.
